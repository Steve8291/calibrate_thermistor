# To Do List CALIBRATE_THERMISTOR
- Test cap_delay.cpp
- Test median and especially average without capacitor. Supposedly the noise will help with averaging.
    - Get buffer size dialed in with slope again and then remove the cap to see if stdDev or stability of output improves.
- Fix calibrate_thermistor link in VectorStats
    - calibrate_thermistor needs pushed to github first.
    - put wiring diagrams in calibrate_thermsitor
- Fix wiring diagrams


# To Do List VECTOR_STATS
- Add speedtest for average .cpp
- Fix wiring diagrams
- Fix calibrate_thermistor link in VectorStats
- Add speedtest for different buffer types: int16 vs int32, etc.
- Add copy of cleaned up array vs vector test.

# All
- push all updates to github
